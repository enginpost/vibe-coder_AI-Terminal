# Feature Stories Template

---

## Standards

### File Naming Convention

```
story--<action-slug>.md
```

- `<action-slug>` is derived from the `<perform some action>` portion of the story statement
- Strip any leading filler phrases before deriving the slug: "I need to", "I want to", "I would like to", "I can", "I am able to", or similar
- Use lowercase kebab-case
- Preserve meaningful capitalisation for proper nouns or acronyms (e.g. AI, API) only if it aids readability; otherwise lowercase everything
- Examples:
  - "add an AI chat configuration to the app" → `story--add-an-AI-chat-configuration-to-the-app.md`
  - "check my used tokens this month" → `story--check-my-used-tokens-this-month.md`
  - "export a report as PDF" → `story--export-a-report-as-PDF.md`

### File Location

Stories live in a subfolder named after their parent feature file, inside `product-documentation/features/`:

```
product-documentation/
└── features/
    ├── feature--<product-name>--<feature-name>.md
    └── feature--<product-name>--<feature-name>/
        ├── story--<action-slug>.md
        └── story--<action-slug>.md
```

Example:

```
product-documentation/
└── features/
    ├── feature--expense-tracker--receipt-capture.md
    └── feature--expense-tracker--receipt-capture/
        ├── story--capture-a-receipt.md
        └── story--review-captured-receipts.md
```

### Relationship to Other Documents

- **Parent**: `feature--<product-name>--<feature-name>.md` — the Stories section links to this story
- **Siblings**: other stories in the same feature folder, or stories in sibling feature folders
- **Inputs**: stories whose outcome this story depends on (linked in the story)
- **Outputs**: stories that depend on this story's outcome (linked in the story)

After a story is created, the parent feature's **Stories** section must be updated with a linked, rank-ordered entry. The user is asked to confirm the ordering each time.

### Document Structure

```markdown
# Story: <Story Title>

**Statement:** As a <role>, I need to <perform some action>, so that <I get the desired outcome>.

**Parent Feature:** [<Feature Name>](../../feature--<product-name>--<feature-name>.md)

## Story Title
<action-slug in readable form — same as the <perform some action> portion of the statement>

## Predecessor Stories
*Stories whose outcome this story depends on as a precondition.*

- [<Story Title>](<relative-path-to-story>.md) — <why this story's outcome is needed here>

> If none: None identified.

## Successor Stories
*Stories that depend on this story's outcome.*

- [<Story Title>](<relative-path-to-story>.md) — <why this story's outcome feeds that story>

> If none: None identified.

## Acceptance Criteria
*Written in Gherkin format. Each criterion describes a need and a verifiable outcome — not a solution.*

- GIVEN <one or more preconditions> WHEN <an action occurs> THEN <one or more verifiable outcome signals>

## Story Size
> [not yet estimated]

## Solution Hypothesis
> [not yet defined]
```

## Instructions for AI

> These instructions tell the AI assistant how to conduct the feature story interview and produce output documents. Apply the Universal Behavioral Rules from SKILL.md throughout — one question, one confirmation, one write at a time.

### Overview

When a user wants to create feature stories, your job is to:

1. **Read the parent feature document** — load acceptance criteria, target users, and pains/gains.
2. **Derive a candidate list of stories** from the feature's acceptance criteria and present them to the user one at a time for confirmation.
3. **Work through each confirmed story individually** using the interview sequence below.
4. **Create the story file** in the correct subfolder as each story is completed.
5. **Update the parent feature's Stories section** after each story, maintaining a rank-ordered linked list.

---

### Phase 1 — Setup

#### Step 1 — Identify the Feature

If not clear from context, ask:
> "Which feature are we writing stories for?"

- Locate `product-documentation/features/feature--<product-name>--<feature-name>.md`.
- Read it fully: acceptance criteria, target users, pains/gains, and existing Stories section.
- Create the story subfolder if it does not exist:
  `product-documentation/features/feature--<product-name>--<feature-name>/`

#### Step 2 — Derive Candidate Stories

Review the feature's acceptance criteria. Identify distinct user needs — each need that can be independently delivered is a candidate story.

Present the candidate list to the user:
> "Based on the acceptance criteria for [Feature Name], here are the candidate stories I see:
> 1. [candidate story statement]
> 2. [candidate story statement]
>
> Does this list look right? Would you add, remove, or reframe any of these?"

Confirm or adjust the list before proceeding. Do not start writing story files yet.

---

### Phase 2 — Story Interview (repeat for each confirmed story)

Work through one story at a time. Complete each story fully before moving to the next.

#### Step 3 — Story Statement

Present the candidate story statement derived from the acceptance criteria:
> "Here is a draft story statement: 'As a [role], I need to [action], so that [outcome].' Does this capture it correctly, or would you like to adjust it?"

- Confirm the role matches a persona from the product vision.
- Ensure the statement describes a **need**, not a solution.
- If the statement implies a solution (e.g., "I need a button to..."), flag it and reframe: *"Let's keep this focused on the need — what does the user need to accomplish, not how?"*
- Derive the `<action-slug>` from the confirmed action phrase. Strip any leading filler ("I need to", "I want to", "I would like to", etc.) so the slug starts with the action verb (e.g. "add an AI chat configuration to the app" → `add-an-AI-chat-configuration-to-the-app`).
- Once confirmed, create the story file stub at the correct path.

#### Step 4 — Predecessor Stories

Ask:
> "Does this story depend on the outcome of any other story as a precondition?"

If yes, present a list of sibling stories from this feature's folder and stories from sibling features:
> "Here are the other stories I can see: [list]. Which of these feed into this one?"

- For each identified predecessor story, confirm: *"[Story title] — is that right?"*
- Capture each as a linked entry with a one-line reason in the current story's **Predecessor Stories** section.
- **Back-link required:** Open the predecessor story file and add the current story as a linked entry in its **Successor Stories** section, with a one-line reason explaining why it follows. If the predecessor's Successor Stories section currently reads `None identified.`, replace that line with the new entry.

If none, record `> If none: None identified.`

#### Step 5 — Successor Stories

Ask:
> "Does any other story depend on the outcome of this story as a precondition?"

Present the same sibling story list as above for reference.

- For each identified successor story, confirm one at a time.
- Capture each as a linked entry with a one-line reason in the current story's **Successor Stories** section.
- **Back-link required:** Open the successor story file and add the current story as a linked entry in its **Predecessor Stories** section, with a one-line reason explaining the dependency. If the successor's Predecessor Stories section currently reads `None identified.`, replace that line with the new entry.

If none, record `> If none: None identified.`

#### Step 6 — Acceptance Criteria

Work through acceptance criteria one at a time.

For the first criterion, ask:
> "Let's define the acceptance criteria. What is the first condition that must be true for this story to be considered done? Think about: what state must the system or user be in, what action triggers the need, and what verifiable signal tells us it worked."

After each answer:

1. Draft a Gherkin statement:
   `GIVEN <preconditions> WHEN <action> THEN <verifiable outcome signals>`
2. Present it to the user for confirmation.
3. Check: does it describe a **need and outcome**, not a solution? If it implies implementation detail, flag and reframe before confirming.
4. Ask: *"Is there anything missing from this criterion — additional preconditions, actions, or outcome signals?"* Add them one at a time.
5. Once confirmed, write it to the file.

Then ask:
> "Is there another acceptance criterion for this story?"

Repeat until the user indicates no more criteria are needed.

**Robustness check**: Before closing out acceptance criteria, review all criteria together and ask:
> "Looking at these criteria together — do they cover the edges? For example, what happens if a precondition isn't met, or if the action partially fails?"

Surface any gaps as suggested additional criteria, one at a time, for the user to accept or decline.

#### Step 7 — Story Size & Solution Hypothesis

Inform the user:
> "I've left placeholders for Story Size and Solution Hypothesis — we won't fill those in now. They'll be addressed later."

Write the placeholders to the file as-is.

#### Step 8 — Update the Parent Feature

After the story file is saved:

1. Open the parent feature document.
2. Add the new story to the **Stories** section as a linked entry:
   `[<Story Title>](<feature-name>/<story-slug>.md)`
3. Present the full updated Stories list:
   > "Here is the updated story list for [Feature Name]. These should be ordered by delivery priority — would you like to reorder anything?"
4. Apply any reordering and save the feature document.

---

### Phase 3 — Wrap Up

After all confirmed stories are complete:

1. Present a summary: stories created, any `[needs clarification]` markers, and the final rank-ordered list in the parent feature.
2. Ask: *"Are there any other stories you'd like to add for this feature, or are we done here?"*
3. If done, remind the user: *"When you're ready to group stories into a deployable release, use the epic template."*
